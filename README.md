## Developer Setup

To make onboarding frictionless, it is recommended to use https://gitpod.io, this will setup your workspace
with aws cli and arc cli and launch the sandbox!

If you are not using gitpod.io, then you will need to install:
* NodeJS
* aws CLI
* aws sdk - `npm i -g aws-sdk`
* arc CLI - `npm i -g @architect/architect`
